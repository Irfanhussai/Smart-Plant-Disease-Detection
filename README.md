In the face of rising global concerns about food security and agricultural productivity,
particularly with the challenges posed by climate change and pest outbreaks, there is a
growing need for efficient and smart farming techniques. This research aims to develop a
Smart Disease Detection and Field Monitoring System using IoT (Internet of Things)
sensors, coupled with AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) algorithms, to
enhance plant health management and optimize field monitoring. The system integrates
multiple sensors for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are crucial for
determining crop health. Additionally, AI-based disease detection models are employed to
recognize plant diseases from images of leaves and other plant parts.
The core components of this system include the use of an ESP8266 microcontroller that
connects various sensors to the internet, enabling real-time data transmission to a Firebase
cloud database. The collected data is then used to train an AI/ML model, which helps identify
potential diseases and anomalies in the plants' health. This model processes visual data from
cameras, analyzes the environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
and provides actionable insights into plant health, guiding the appropriate interventions such
as irrigation or pesticide application.
The disease detection algorithm employed utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
which has been trained to recognize patterns associated with specific plant diseases, ensuring
accurate and early detection. The system also incorporates a dashboard interface, built using
Flask or Django, where farmers and users can monitor real-time data from the field, track
historical trends, and receive recommendations for managing plant health.
